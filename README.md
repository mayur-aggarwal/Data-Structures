# Data-Structures
## *_Simple implementation of different Algorithms_*

This repository contains simple implementations of data structures with example. Please message me for any doubt or query related to implementation.
Following ML algos has been implemented.
1. Merge Sort
2. BST based on AVL tree

* ### *Merge Sort:*
It is divide & conquer based sorting algorithm.
It first divides unsorted list into n sublist & then repeatedly merge sorted sublist till all sublists get merged.
Below is the diagram from wikipedia visualising the merge-sort algorithm
